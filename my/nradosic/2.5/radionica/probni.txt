A documentary about bird nerds — specifically, a bunch of New Zealanders who breed fowl for avian beauty contests — Slavko Martinov’s film makes calculated use of an old formula: a study of unglamorous, slightly eccentric folk pursuing a funny old hobby. Even by the standards of such films, there’s not much drama, but I was amused, engaged and touched by the goings-on at the Christchurch Poultry, Bantam and Pigeon Club. The movie could easily inspire one of those down-to-earth feelgood comedies for which antipodean film-makers have a bit of a knack.
